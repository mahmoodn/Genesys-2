This repository is contains tutorial to work with [Diligent Genesys 2](https://digilent.com/shop/genesys-2-amd-kintex-7-fpga-development-board/) FPGA board which runs a Kintex 7 chip. During the installation of Vivado, ensure that Kintex chip package has been selected as shown below.
The Genesys 2 board uses the Xilinx Kintex-7 XC7K325T FPGA. This specific, high-capacity chip requires a Full-Feature License (often called a Node-Locked or Floating License) for the Vivado Design Suite to unlock the necessary synthesis and implementation tools.
